This project implements a desktop-based graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for a Book Recommendation System. The system suggests books based on user-entered keywords.
It can display the published date and ratings for each book as selected by the user via the settings icon.
Users can refresh the recommendations to view the next set of suggestions.
